Natural language processing ex2

in the py file you can find our implementation to the
brown corpus.
to use our class you should create an instance of
BrownCorpus class with the following params
	- percentage: the percentage of the data that you want 
					to use for the test validation
	- specialPower: the kind of viterbi algorithm that you
					want to use. 
		options are
			- '' - regular viterbi algorithm
			- 'PLUS_ONE' - add 1 smoothing viterbi	
			- 'PSEUDO' - viterbi algorithm with pseudo words for non-frequent words
			- 'PSEUDO_PLUS' - same as pseudo with +1 smoothing.

to find the tag that maximize the word we can use the function get_max_tag("hello")			
			
to evaluate specific sentence you can run bc.viterbi("My dog barks") and you will
get a string of tags that represent every word in your sentence.

all the implementation using python dictionaries with some documentation on the relevant functions.
